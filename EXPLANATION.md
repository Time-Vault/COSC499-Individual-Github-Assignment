In my program there are two functions; one which waits for a given period of time and another which creates a string with the word hello repeated a specified number of times. For testing the timer, the unit test passes an amount of time to the program to wait, and assuming no errors occur, the program will return a true value. If something breaks along the way, the try/catch I have set up will return false. In the Multihello string function, the unit test passes the desired number of hellos to the function, and it will return the completed string. If everything works, the returned string will have the correct number of hellos, otherwise the test will fail.
